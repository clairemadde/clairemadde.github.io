<p><strong>Natural:</strong> Finding the right makeup to wear when you’re going for a natural look can be more complex than you think. You don’t want anything too cakey, too bright, or too dark. And we all know, that looking natural does indeed require SOME makeup application – and some skill, too. The best tip that we have for you is to wear colors close to your natural skin tone, and ones that just enhance and perfect your skin. For your best natural look, follow the tips and tricks below, followed by some of our favorite beauty products to use to get your natural looking makeup just right.</p>
<p><strong>Glam: </strong>We might have passed New Year’s Eve already, but there are still plenty of reasons to practice your makeup and get all glammed up! Valentine’s Day, for example, is just around the corner. Who says you need an excuse to make yourself feel fancy, though? We like to pain a pretty face for any night out, but our favourite time to really go wild with our style is for a girls’ night out!</p>
